This mod is possible thanks to the skill and determination of Cire Zero. I want to take a moment to say thank you for taking this project on, and for all the hard work you've poured into it. 

This mod sees the arena's mat and aprons replaced with real world companies All Japan Pro Wrestling (Budokan), New Japan Pro Wrestling (Tokyo Dome Ramp), Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling (Tokyo Dome), Michinoku Pro (Korakuen Hall), IWA Japan (Kawasaki Stadium)

Also included are some new CAW parts, like Vader's black mask, the Can-Am Connection's trunks, and Tajiri's blue and white trunks. Everything that needs to be unlocked in the vanilla rom is locked here, and will require you to play through and unlock things as normal. 

The turnbuckle pads have been switched to the corner cushions seen in NJPW, IWA Japan, and FMW. The colors on the pads are inverted, if anyone wants to correct this, I'd greatly appreciate it, and would gladly add you as a contributor to the mod. Unfortunately, seeing as the turnbuckle pads are a global change, it isn't possible to give AJPW and Michinoku Pro their correct pad type.

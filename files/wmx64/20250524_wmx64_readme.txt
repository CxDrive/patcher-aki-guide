INTRO
-----
So here it is, my total comversion of Wrestlemania 2000 N64 to "What if there was a WWF AKI game released in the early 90's that was based on the rosters of the 16 bit games"!

Any graphics or codes I make are pretty much open for anyone to use if they want.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome.


TO PATCH THE GAME
-----------------
1.  Go to this C-Drive's website, which is pretty awesome for supplying everything needed except for the rom.  Also check out the other awesome creations by Freem and Ragdas, they're pretty damn good!
 
https://patcher.aki.guide/

2. Patch with file with the xdelta program (which I conviently placed in the zip file)

For this game, the no other files are is required!  So you can play it on emulator or on real hardware!

THE ROSTER
----------
I decided to make a roster based on the rosters for the WWF 16-bit era of games.  That includes the SNES and Genesis versions of WWF Super Wrestlemania, Royal Rumble, RAW, and the Sega CD version of Rage in the Cage.  I also added some characters that were missing from WCW SN as well as some characters, that although they didn't match the era, they were characters I still wanted to add in the game to play as.  With the hidden characters, I decided to go more the echo fighter route where a majority of the characters will be alternate versions of existing characters.

As for the unlockables.  If you press Start on the title screen, you will see several hints to unlock them.  These are based on the ones from WM2K if that helps.  Just fight the correct way, or use the correct characters, and you'll have 7 more characters...
...or you could use a Game Shark code (8109ED5A FFFF), I won't judge ya.

Some of the titantron names are off since they used the same text entries as the music ones.  Nothing major though.

THANKS TO
---------
Most of all, Freem for his very hard work on VPW Studio, I consider myself very fortunate to have the opportunity to beta test this program, and appreciate all he has done.  Also, go to Freem's VPW2 stuff and play VPW2 Freem edition (which I also used as a base for several movesets) at...

In addition to creating the WM2000 improvement hack, S.K.Styles made some great spreadsheets that I used to convert various moves and taunts from the other games with their properties intact.

The gang on the "AKI Wrestling Game Hacking" and "AKI Rom Hack Room" discords helped a lot with their patience with all my questions.

Thanks to Retro Randy, MelonBread, KWG, Ragdas, Barskio, AKIFan, PablosCorner, DaveSavedTheDay, ChuckiePK, TylerBlack, DylanRulez69, NamiyoVT and anyone I forgot to mention here.

Sir Antonic, Rag Das, Krayzie2k99 and Orson helped out big time with some of the imported moves.

Sean O Connor, AmitDaybeen and Krangledangle have been showcasing my other projects, "Project Outsider" and "WCW Saturday Night".

DJKM's old Firepro saves on FPR and FPWW gave me a good idea for character movesets.

There were also various moveset and CAW info references from CAW movelists, DNewgrounds, Gazwefc

The No Mercy Library - A great archive for codes and movelists.  Most of the codes I use in this mod come from here.

CAWPlace - A great archive for movelists and outfit ideas.

WildFB's archive - Creator of the Moveset Editor, the utility that made the hardest part of No Mercy Editing very simple.

OTHER INSPIRATIONS
------------------
Wrestling Bios - He does very detailed videos on the monday night war, and individual bios.  How did I discover him?  His bio for Glacier popped up when I was searching for it while researching for Project Outsider!  The channel is great for learning missing details about wrestling with a little humor mixed in.

E-BEGGING!
----------
Just wanted to set one of these up.  More of a tip jar than anything.  I definitely won't be putting stuff behind a paywall.

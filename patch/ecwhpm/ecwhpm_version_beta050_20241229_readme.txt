ECW: House Party Mixtape
released 12/30/2024
by G.M.Spectre (gm.spect@gmail.com)

INTRO
-----
So here it is, my total comversion of Wrestlemania 2000 N64 to "ECW Megamix"
Any graphics or codes I make are pretty much open for anyone to use if they want.


WHY IS IT CALLED HOUSE PARTY MIXTAPE
------------------------------------
1. Public Enemy represents the time I started watching ECW after taping it overnight on the MSG network.
2. The roster is a "mixtape" of the wrestlers in ECW from Eastern to the end in 2001.
3. To me, the music was a huge part of the identity of ECW.


TO PATCH THE GAME
-----------------
1.  Go to this C-Drive's website, which is pretty awesome for supplying everything needed except for the rom.  Also check out the other awesome creations by Freem and Ragdas, they're pretty damn good!
 
https://patcher.aki.guide/

2. Patch with file with the xdelta program (which I conviently placed in the zip file)

For this game, the no other files are is required!  So you can play it on emulator or on real hardware!


WHAT IS IN THE GAME
-------------------
- Complete roster conversion
- All unlockable characters set
- All entrance and background music converted
- Raw ring changed to basic ECW ring
- A majority of fonts and in game messages changed to the "Ad Lib" font (the one used for ECW Hype Central)
- All entrance animations have the lights and effects removed
- Many moves and taunts added


WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE
---------------------------
- Port the conversion to SK Styles 1.1 Wrestlemania 2000 improvement hack
- Convert the rest of the arenas
- Fix the opening/credit animations/messages so it's not just the WWF one with ECW characters.
- Rewrite the "Extreme Road Tour"/"Road to Wrestlemania" mode cutscenes
- Slightly tweak movesets with the SK Styles 1.1 hack additions
- Fix any heights and weights that may have not gone through
- Set in game tag teams
- Set all managers and seconds to wrestlers
- Give managers individual movesets
- Redo some of the music (possibly add more?)
- Fix the names so some aren't incomplete (actually more difficult than it seems)
- Get Sandman to always take the cane (the cane can't be set as "Specific weapon" in CAW mode)


WHAT I WON'T DO
---------------
- Create an overpriced 90 dollar cart with a sticker calling it ECW House Party Live with a picture of the 2002 TNA roster (Sorry? Sorry? I'M NOT SORRY!)

Special no-prize to who gets that comment in the parenthisis.

DX4Life
I was a bit iffy about crediting him, because he was the same DX4Life guy from the WWE 2k modding scene who faked his own suicide in mid 2024.  That really pissed me off for many reasons.

OTHER THANKS TO
----------------
Most of all, Freem for his very hard work on VPW Studio, I consider myself very fortunate to have the opportunity to beta test this program, and appreciate all he has done.  Also, go to Freem's VPW2 stuff and play VPW2 Freem edition (which I also used as a base for several movesets) at...
https://vpw.ajworld.net/vpw2freem

S.K.Styles made some great spreadsheets that I used to convert various moves and taunts from the other games with their properties intact.  He's also modding the base game of WM2K to get rid of some bugs and make some QOL changed.

The gang on the "AKI Wrestling Game Hacking" and "AKI Rom Hack Room" discords helped a lot with their patience with all my questions.

Thanks to Retro Randy, MelonBread, KWG, Ragdas, Barskio, AKIFan, PablosCorner, DaveSavedTheDay, ChuckiePK, TylerBlack, DylanRulez69, NamiyoVT and anyone I forgot to mention here.

Sir Antonic, Rag Das, Krayzie2k99 and Orson helped out big time with some of the imported moves.

Sean O Connor, AmitDaybeen and Krangledangle have been showcasing my other projects, "Project Outsider" and "WCW Saturday Night".

DJKM's old Firepro saves on FPR and FPWW gave me a good idea for character movesets.

There were also various moveset and CAW info references from CAW movelists, DNewgrounds, Gazwefc

The No Mercy Library - A great archive for codes and movelists.  Most of the codes I use in this mod come from here.

CAWPlace - A great archive for movelists and outfit ideas.

WildFB's archive - Creator of the Moveset Editor, the utility that made the hardest part of No Mercy Editing very simple.

OTHER INSPIRATIONS
------------------
Wrestling Bios - He does very detailed videos on the monday night war, and individual bios.  How did I discover him?  His bio for Glacier popped up when I was searching for it while researching for Project Outsider!  The channel is great for learning missing details about wrestling with a little humor mixed in.

More of a tip jar than anything.  I definitely won't be putting stuff behind a paywall.

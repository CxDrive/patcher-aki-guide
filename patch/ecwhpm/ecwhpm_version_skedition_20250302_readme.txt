ECW: House Party Mixtape: SK Edition

SK edition Released 3/2/2025
Originally released 12/30/2024
Final version
by G.M.Spectre and S.K. Stylez

NOTE - 
The original patch crashed when used on hardware or an emulator with the "Emulate Frame Buffer" option on in the graphics settings.  I decided to release an alternate build with everything changed except for the new names, so there will be modified and a few with missing letters. 

ECW House Party - SK Edition.xdelta
Original release with fixed names, but crashes with "Emulate Frame Buffer" and on hardware

ECW House Party - SK Edition - alternate.xdelta
Alternate build with unfixed names, but doesn't crash on hardware

INTRO
-----
So here it is, my total comversion of Wrestlemania 2000 N64 to "ECW Megamix".  I finally added everything I put off from the 0.5 release.  Thanks to S.K.Stylez for creating the WM2000 improvement hack that had a ton of quality of life changes for playing and editing, and a huge save when it came to editing the default names in the rom!


Any graphics or codes I make are pretty much open for anyone to use if they want.


WHY IS IT CALLED HOUSE PARTY MIXTAPE
------------------------------------
1. Public Enemy represents the time I started watching ECW after taping it overnight on the MSG network.
2. The roster is a "mixtape" of the wrestlers in ECW from Eastern to the end in 2001.
3. To me, the music was a huge part of the identity of ECW.


TO PATCH THE GAME
-----------------
1.  Go to this C-Drive's website, which is pretty awesome for supplying everything needed except for the rom.  Also check out the other awesome creations by Freem and Ragdas, they're pretty damn good!
 
https://patcher.aki.guide/

2. Patch with file with the xdelta program (which I conviently placed in the zip file)

For this game, the no other files are is required!  So you can play it on emulator or on real hardware!

OTHER THANKS TO
----------------
Most of all, Freem for his very hard work on VPW Studio, I consider myself very fortunate to have the opportunity to beta test this program, and appreciate all he has done.  Also, go to Freem's VPW2 stuff and play VPW2 Freem edition (which I also used as a base for several movesets) at...
https://vpw.ajworld.net/vpw2freem

In addition to the WM2000 improvement hack and help with names, S.K.Styles made some great spreadsheets that I used to convert various moves and taunts from the other games with their properties intact.  He's also modding the base game of WM2K to get rid of some bugs and make some QOL changed.

The gang on the "AKI Wrestling Game Hacking" and "AKI Rom Hack Room" discords helped a lot with their patience with all my questions.

Thanks to Retro Randy, MelonBread, KWG, Ragdas, Barskio, AKIFan, PablosCorner, DaveSavedTheDay, ChuckiePK, TylerBlack, DylanRulez69, NamiyoVT and anyone I forgot to mention here.

Sir Antonic, Rag Das, Krayzie2k99 and Orson helped out big time with some of the imported moves.

DJKM's old Firepro saves on FPR and FPWW gave me a good idea for character movesets.

There were also various moveset and CAW info references from CAW movelists, DNewgrounds, Gazwefc

The No Mercy Library - A great archive for codes and movelists.  Most of the codes I use in this mod come from here.

OTHER INSPIRATIONS
------------------
Wrestling Bios - He does very detailed videos on the monday night war, and individual bios.  How did I discover him?  His bio for Glacier popped up when I was searching for it while researching for Project Outsider!  The channel is great for learning missing details about wrestling with a little humor mixed in.

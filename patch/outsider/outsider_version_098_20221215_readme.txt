Project Outsider: 2022
beta .98 - released 12/16/2022
by G.M.Spectre (gm.spect@gmail.com)

1. Intro

Hey, it's G.M.Spectre.  You may know me from my goofy ass fighting games or those two Botchamania endings.  Well several years back, I made a mod full of goofy gimmicks, The original Project Outsider.  This time around, I was fortunate to beta test Freem's VPW Studio, and learned a lot more about what makes this game engine tick.  The biggest things I learned were how to mess with hex editing, and getting stuff into the rom without any cheat codes or external texture replacements.  So here it is, and the best part is, it can also be played on real hardware with an Everdrive!

So about the mod, I originally wanted to make a mod full of goofy gimmicks (Basically, 10% smart mark with 90% batshit crazy), and pattern the roster so that the characters would fit in with the dialogue used in the various championship modes.  Since then I was able to actually edit the in game graphics, so the AKI style graphics I originally used were ready for me to convert so the VPW Studio would plug them into the game, and the championship mode text could also be edited so the Championship story mode is much improved!  However there were a lot of limits with the rom, so there may be a little less variety in outfits.

Any graphics or codes I make are pretty much open for anyone to use if they want.  I intend on releasing a big pack of the resources I have created as soon as they are better organized.

Fun fact!  I decided to name it after an old newsletter parody that I used to contribute to.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome.

2. To run this patch

The patch is provided in xdelta format, and is meant to be patched to an unmodified WWF No Mercy NTSC-U ROM in Z64 format.  If your ROM is in a different format (e.g. V64 or N64), you will need a tool to convert it.  I find these work well and are pretty easy to use.

https://www.zophar.net/utilities/n64aud/tool-n64.html

WWF No Mercy NTSC-U v1.0 (NW4E) in Z64 format, and just plug that and the patch using the 
xdelta program (which I conviently placed in the zip file)

BTW for the previous section I used an altered version of Freem's instructions here at...

https://vpw.ajworld.net/vpw2freem/Manual/#patching
(hey while you're there, check out the patches for VPW2 Freem Edition, WCW/NWO Revenji and Summit: VPW Gamma, they're pretty damn good!)

For this game, the save file is required, but I have it set so nothing is unlocked.  There were some things I wanted to change in the rom before I wanted to distribute the game w/o the save, mostly dealing with the character order in the select screen, but after thinking about it, I'm okay with including a ".fla" file.

That said, I am including a ".mpk" file with the 18 characters in the CAW spaces and edited the Smackdown mall if you're the person who likes to unlock things.

7. Assorted notes
ReplacedItems.txt has the information of everything that has been modded in the rom.

Jo Amon is specially edited so he has 5 stats and has access to more powerful strong grapples than if he was created through the game.

On the other end, jobbers (Booger, etc) are specially edited so they have all 0 stats and less powerful moves than if they were created through the game.

Things I want to do to consider this finished, in order of what I feel is most to least important.

- Hack the default spaces in the select screen so a game save file isn't needed (there is a problem with this normally making it difficult to organize them in the correct stables)
- Fix Hogan Legdrop so CPU does it correctly
- Replace the audience graphics

Characters taken out for various reasons
- Steve Austin '96
- Mark Henry
- Kurt Angle
- Bear
- Akuma
- Batman/Rat Tights
- Robin/Mask Boy
- Necro Butcher

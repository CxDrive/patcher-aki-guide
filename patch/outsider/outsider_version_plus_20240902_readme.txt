Project Outsider Plus
beta .98 - released 12/16/2022
Plus version - released 9/2/2024
by G.M.Spectre (gm.spect@gmail.com)

1. Intro

Hey, it's G.M.Spectre.  You may know me from my goofy ass fighting games or those two Botchamania endings.  Well several years back, I made a mod full of goofy gimmicks, The original Project Outsider.  This time around, I was fortunate to beta test Freem's VPW Studio, and learned a lot more about what makes this game engine tick.  The biggest things I learned were how to mess with hex editing, and getting stuff into the rom without any cheat codes or external texture replacements.  So here it is, and the best part is, it can also be played on real hardware with an Everdrive!

So about the mod, I originally wanted to make a mod full of goofy gimmicks (Basically, 10% smart mark with 90% batshit crazy), and pattern the roster so that the characters would fit in with the dialogue used in the various championship modes.  Since then I was able to actually edit the in game graphics, so the AKI style graphics I originally used were ready for me to convert so the VPW Studio would plug them into the game, and the championship mode text could also be edited so the Championship story mode is much improved!  However there were a lot of limits with the rom, so there may be a little less variety in outfits.

Any graphics or codes I make are pretty much open for anyone to use if they want.  I intend on releasing a big pack of the resources I have created as soon as they are better organized.

Fun fact!  I decided to name it after an old newsletter parody that I used to contribute to.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome.

ADDENDUM FOR 9/2024:
With Retro Randy's No Mercy Plus 2.1 update, I decided to take advantage of all that it can do, as well as what I have learned by making my WCW and WWF mods.  Roster wise it is not a huge patch, but there are so many tiny changes that build it up to being the complete game that was in my head.

2. Updates from version .98 to Plus

Changes that I can make, because of Retro Randy's No Mercy Plus 2.1 rom
- Full entrances for the wrestlers
- Many more music tracks added with better quality.
- Gameboy mode playable (with a new script!)

Other changes
- Background music added to menu, cutscene, and matches.
- Rey Misterio Jr. Added (with another character hidden in the alt)
- The greatest finishing move of all time has been added (thanks to Sir Antonic)
- Many more costume items added (in preparation for a later release?)

3. To run this patch

The patch is provided in xdelta format, and is meant to be patched to an unmodified No Mercy NTSC-U v1.0 (NWXE) in Z64 format.  If your ROM is in a different format (e.g. V64 or N64), you will need a tool to convert it.  I find that these work well and are pretty easy to use.

http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/
https://www.zophar.net/utilities/n64aud/tool-n64.html

To patch the game either

- Go to C-Drive's website, which is pretty awesome for supplying everything needed except for the rom.  Also check out the other awesome creations by Freem and Ragdas, they're pretty damn good!
 
https://patcher.aki.guide/

- Patch with file withthe xdelta program (which I conviently placed in the zip file)

For this game, the save file is required.  There were some things I wanted to change in the rom before I wanted to distribute the game w/o the save, mostly dealing with the character order in the select screen, but after thinking about it, I'm okay with including a ".fla" file.  

IMPORTANT NOTE!
There are two ".fla" files included because some everdrive clones wont be able to use to it with out a bit of hacking the file (huge thanks to Platynumx for the work on that!).  Try the emulator one first, and if it doesn't work, try the everdrive one.

8. Assorted notes
ReplacedItems.txt has the information of everything that has been modded in the rom.
Note that there are more items in preparation for the aforementioned NM Plus v3 Update!

Jo Amon is specially edited so he has 5 stats and has access to more powerful strong grapples than if he was created through the game.

On the other end, jobbers (Booger, etc) are specially edited so they have all 0 stats and less powerful moves than if they were created through the game.

Things I want to do to consider this finished, in order of what I feel is most to least important.

- Hack the default spaces in the select screen so a game save file isn't needed (No Mercy Plus v3 will hopefully fix this)
- Fix Hogan Legdrop so CPU does it correctly
- Replace the audience graphics
